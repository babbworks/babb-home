 The tools we build are made to last. They're the result of internal, global and galactic collaboration! Every tool shares a common purpose: help individuals work and learn on their own, and with others. By default, tools are personal, private and powerful. Each tool that we forge is designed to overcome the any limitations that users may face, from technical to educational to situational.
 <br><br>
Workwarrior is the first tool we built.
 <br><br>
Workpads is the first mobile app we built. It's a system for creating and sharing business records that doesn't rely on centralized infrastructures to function. It's more than a product, it's a long-term project to help people of every capacity engage in business and the life-long learning that creates success.
<br><br>
BASICS is a protocol that brings together different tools and systems into one architecture that serves individuals. It stands for "Business Assistance System" and its purpose is to identify and document the digital tools and processes that enable entrepreneurs to execute and take action. The protocol outlines universal elements of a "B.A.S." and standardizes the ways that different, divergent and even competing tools can connect into a private BASICS, serving as a type of Operation System for business users, i.e. a Personal Business System.
<br><br>
BABBS aka "babb-s" is short for "Babb System". It's a command line program for managing exchanges, tracking activities and creating documents based on the BASICS Protocol. Many of the tools within "babbs" are branded using the universal terminology which BASICS uses to express the "architecture of entrepreneurship". Some of the tools are being developed as stand-alone utilities, for example the "Times" provides a simplified way to generate and interact with the numerous document types which babbs provides support for.
