<h2>Overview</h2>
 <p>This project is based entirely on open source tools and extensions. Its purpose is to grow the ecosystem that supports these command line tools and to increase the financial supports available for the creators of the individual projects and their contributors. Each project that Workwarrior relies on is the result of the creative and voluntary efforts of people around the world. The goal of this project is to highlight these achievements by bringing together great tools within one useable system that can amplify their impact.</p>

<p>Workwarrior (WW) is designed around the 4 pillars of productivity: Tasks, Time, Notes, and Money. As people work on different projects, the need to track these 4 things quickly becomes complex. Very often though, tracking money and performing basic accounting is excluded. WW is a long-term attempt to bring all these pieces together using an intuitive set of commands that helps amateurs and experts improve and accelerate how they work and learn.</p>
